**initcn** is an infrastructure and configuration registry for Next.js applications, built on the shadcn registry architecture. The goal is simple: **help you ship infrastructure faster**.

## Not a library—a configuration distribution

Like shadcn/ui, initcn is not a typical install-from-NPM library. It's an open collection of infrastructure configurations you can copy, modify, and customize directly in your codebase. You own the code. No wrappers, no overrides, no fighting with dependencies.

Setting up infrastructure is time-consuming. Authentication, internationalization, payments, database integrations—each one has configuration decisions and boilerplate that take time to get right. initcn gives you battle-tested starting points so you can focus on what makes your product unique.

## Why initcn?

- **Open source & copy-first**: Direct access to configurations so you can adapt them to your needs
- **Ship faster**: Stop rebuilding the same infrastructure setups from scratch
- **shadcn compatible**: Works with the shadcn CLI and your existing setup
- **Production-ready**: Battle-tested patterns for authentication, i18n, payments, and more
- **Flexible**: Start with templates and customize them for your specific requirements
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with exported types
