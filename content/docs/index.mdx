---

Welcome to initcn! This guide will help you set up and start using our infrastructure configurations in your project.

## Quick Start

First, make sure you have [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) set up in your project, then add the initcn registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@initcn": "https://initcn.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

## Configure Your Project

Choose your database/ORM preference to get personalized installation commands:

<ConfigModal />

<CurrentOrmBadge />

## Install Features

### Authentication

OTP + OAuth authentication with email verification, rate limiting, and session management.

<InstallCommand feature="auth" />

### Payments

Stripe subscription management with webhooks, checkout sessions, and customer portal.

<InstallCommand feature="payments" />

### Internationalization

Type-safe i18n with next-international for server and client components.

<InstallCommand feature="i18n" />

## Initialize MCP (optional)

This adds configuration to your IDE, enabling you to use the infrastructure configs directly with AI assistance. The AI will have full context of the entire initcn library.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest mcp init
```
