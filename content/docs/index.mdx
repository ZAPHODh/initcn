description: Set up and start using initcn infrastructure configurations in your Next.js project.
---

Welcome to initcn! This guide will help you set up and start using our infrastructure configurations in your project.

## Quick Start

First, make sure you have [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) set up in your project, then add the initcn registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@initcn": "https://initcn.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

## Configure Your Project

Use the **Configure Project** button in the header to select your database/ORM preference. This will personalize all installation commands across the documentation.

## Initialize MCP (optional)

This adds configuration to your IDE, enabling you to use the infrastructure configs directly with AI assistance. The AI will have full context of the entire initcn library.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest mcp init
```
