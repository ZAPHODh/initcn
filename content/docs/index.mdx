**initcn** is an infrastructure and configuration registry for Next.js applications, built on the shadcn registry architecture. The goal is simple: **help you ship infrastructure faster**.

## Not ui components -  infraestructure components.

Like shadcn/ui, initcn is not a typical install-from-NPM library. It's an open collection of infrastructure configurations you can copy, modify, and customize directly in your codebase. You own the code. No wrappers, no overrides.

Setting up infrastructure is time-consuming. Authentication, internationalization, payments... initcn gives you battle-tested starting points so you can focus on what makes your product unique.
