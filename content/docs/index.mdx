description: Set up and start using initcn infrastructure configurations in your Next.js project.
---

Welcome to initcn! This guide will help you set up and start using our infrastructure configurations in your project.

## Quick Start

First, make sure you have [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) set up in your project, then add the initcn registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@initcn": "https://initcn.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

## Configure Your Project

Click the <ConfigToggle className="inline-flex mx-1" /> button (next to the search) to select your stack preferences (framework and ORM). This will personalize all installation commands throughout the documentation for your specific setup.

## Initialize MCP (optional)

This adds configuration to your IDE, enabling you to use the infrastructure configs directly with AI assistance. The AI will have full context of the entire initcn library.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest mcp init
```
